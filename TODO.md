Todo
====

* Remember last focused tab, reinitialize it on startup.
* Add highlighting tab.
* Add line numbers.
* Be able to watch files that do not exist yet. May be complicated since that
  directory has to exist first. Also may be complicated because the file
  chooser might expect a file that exists.
* UI indications when watched files are deleted, are created, another open tab
  has been modified/deleted.
* Add font / display customizations.

Done
====
* Add smart scrolling (Oct 31 2013).
